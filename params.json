{"name":"CSE-118-living-room-of-awesome","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to the CSE 118 Living Room of Awesome project page\r\nOur project's goal is to create a smart living room with low-cost barrier entry\r\n\r\n```\r\nMembers:\r\nDerek Huynh\r\nKirsten Koa\r\nCalvin Nguyen\r\nPatrick Torbett\r\nChu Shao\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Project Updates\r\nWe currently have started implementing multiple features for the kinect to interact with an Arduino. We will originally utilize skeletal and audio tracking, but we are also currently looking forward to utilizing inferred visuals as well.\r\n\r\nOn the Arduino side we will develop an AC outlet that uses a solid state relay to manage light dimming. In addition we are currently working on figuring out the best way to integrate a servo to pull open the curtains. \r\n\r\nOn our stack we decided to go with Processing and OpenNI, as integrating Processing with Arduino is a lot simpler than integrating Visual Studio. In addition, Processing is in Java, and thus we have changed most of our stack. \r\n\r\n### Misc Questions\r\n```\r\nWho are our customer segments?\r\n```\r\nWe have two target groups for this project:\r\n25-30 age group with small extra disposable income\r\n65-80 old people who struggle with daily tasks\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nWhy are we developing this product?\r\n```\r\nFor the younger audience, be able to achieve a gateway to having an integrated hi-tech home for low costs.\r\n\r\nFor the older audience, a simpler way of using common household electronics ie turning on light and turning off light without moving too much. Hopefully, we can even automate it so that many devices can be controlled just by presence.\r\n\r\n``` \r\nWhat is the hypothesis that we would need to test by talking with the customer segments?\r\n```\r\nWe would need to test out the hypothesis of different motions as we are not sure whether or not the motions currently developed will be easy to use for the older audience.\r\n\r\n```\r\nWhat is the problem we are solving?\r\n```\r\nWe would like to create a low cost entry to the realm of home automation. The project would be able to introduce more convenience in daily tasks, especially for an older target audience, but also provide a way to adapt previously non automated devices to be automated. \r\n\r\n```\r\nFor who are we solving it for and why do they care?\r\n```\r\nWe are solving it for two markets. The younger market can have features that would make life easier and saves time and create a framework of a future Jarvis-like home automation system.\r\nFor the older market we would like to provide a way for the older people to simplify life as they can have many device controlled with just simple gestures or being in the presence.
