Except on Tuesdays (Fizbin) Kinect Gesture Library

##Fizbin.Kinect.Gestures.Demo
Included in the repository is a simple demo application which shows how to easily set up a Kinect enabled application to recognize gestures.

###Requirements
The gesture demo takes advantage of helper classes included in the Developer Toolkit, which can be downloaded from the Microsoft Kinect for Windows homepage.
* `Microsoft.Kinect.Toolkit` – Used to reference to `KinectSensorChooser` component, for automatically finding and handling updates to the Kinect sensor.
* `Microsoft.Samples.Kinect.WpfViewers` – Used to reference the `KinectSensorManager` data model class.

The packages should be placed in the same directory as the Fizbin.Kinect.Gestures solution.

Both packages can be installed to your computer from the "Developer Toolkit Browser" by installing the "Microsoft.Kinect.Toolkit" and "Kinect Explorer".

###Executing on Gestures

In order to capture and execute on a gesture we initialize the gesture recognizer’s callback function in `InitializeKinectServices()`:

```csharp
gestureController = new GestureController();
gestureController.GestureRecognized += OnGestureRecognized;
```

After the `GestureController` is initialized you can register new gestures with it.  A gesture is made up of one or more `IRelativeGestureSegment`s, which are passed to the `AddGesture` function of the `GestureController` along with a string which can be used for identifying the gesture when the `GestureRecognized` event is fired.

```csharp
IRelativeGestureSegment[] swipeleftSegments = new IRelativeGestureSegment[3];
swipeleftSegments[0] = new SwipeLeftSegment1();
swipeleftSegments[1] = new SwipeLeftSegment2();
swipeleftSegments[2] = new SwipeLeftSegment3();
gestureController.AddGesture("SwipeLeft", swipeleftSegments);
```

The gesture recognizer analyzes data from the skeleton.  Each time we receive a new skeleton frame we send it off to the gesture recognizer for review:

```csharp
private void OnSkeletonFrameReady(object sender, SkeletonFrameReadyEventArgs e)
{
        using (SkeletonFrame frame = e.OpenSkeletonFrame())
        {
                if (frame == null)
                        return;

                // resize the skeletons array if needed
                if (skeletons.Length != frame.SkeletonArrayLength)
                        skeletons = new Skeleton[frame.SkeletonArrayLength];

                // get the skeleton data
                frame.CopySkeletonDataTo(skeletons);

                foreach (var skeleton in skeletons)
                {
                        // skip the skeleton if it is not being tracked
                        if (skeleton.TrackingState != SkeletonTrackingState.Tracked)
                                continue;

                        // update the gesture controller
                        gestureController.UpdateAllGestures(skeleton);
                }
        }
}
```

If a gesture is recognized an event will be fired.  We go to our event callback and execute on the type of gesture returned:

```csharp
private void OnGestureRecognized(object sender, GestureEventArgs e)
{
        switch (e.GestureName)
        {
                case "Menu":
                        Gesture = "Menu";
                        break;
                case "WaveRight":
                        Gesture = "Wave Right";
                        break;
                case "WaveLeft":
                        Gesture = "Wave Left";
                        break;
                case "JoinedHands":
                        Gesture = "Joined Hands";
                        break;
                case "SwipeLeft":
                        Gesture = "Swipe Left";
                        break;
                case "SwipeRight":
                        Gesture = "Swipe Right";
                        break;
                case "ZoomIn":
                        Gesture = "Zoom In";
                        break;
                case "ZoomOut":
                        Gesture = "Zoom Out";
                        break;

                default:
                        break;
        }
}
```

That is all that is required.  Update any Kinect enabled application with the above lines, in addition to including the gesture library project, and you can execute on basic gestures!
